## About

This repo is kinda like a playground for me to experiment with implementing MVVM-C and toying with SwiftUI & UIKit, all code here is public & free to use =]
Also this repo illustrate my passion for Swift & it's growing framework SwiftUI and how it can be powerful if you combine with UIKit (mostly navigation & internal API's)
